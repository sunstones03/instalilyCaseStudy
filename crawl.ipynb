      "This pump inlet grommet is a genuine OEM replacement part that is compatible with various models of dishwashers. It is made of rubber and has a diameter of approximately 2.5 inches. The grommet is used to create a watertight seal in the area between the inlet hose and the circulation pump. This prevents the dishwasher from leaking, and it also helps to absorb minor shocks and vibrations that occur while the dishwasher is running. It is normal for the grommet to wear down over time or become damaged from exposure to water, heat, and chemicals. \n",

      "WARNING!!! This is NOT the grommet that goes on the \"pump stem\" in the center\n",
      "I purchased this misguided by the official response to \"Doug\" on April 17, 2018, which at the time was labeled as \"most helpful\". This is NOT the little grommet in the center. This is a big grommet that goes no the supply pump. This is #14 in the diagram. (#15 is actually the clamp that holds it). If you are looking for the little grommet that goes on that stem on the central recirculation pump, that part is not available, it only comes fused on the sump, and for replacing the sump you have to disassemble the whole bottom part of the dishwasher, pumps, sensors, valves, hose...even this big grommet. A lot of work, and since you are at it, you might want to replace both grommets. If you need THIS big grommet (#14) only, then it is not so much work, just take out one clamp, one connected cable, and the grommet to replace. But check if your machine has reusable clamps, because if not, you might want to order a new clamp. Good luck!
